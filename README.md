# aws-devops-resources

<p align="center"><img src="images/githubawsdevops.png"/></p>

Simple static web site for collecting resources for AWS , DevOps, Networking, Programming and all other important things for learning. It's my idea which I had through the AWS She Builds program for womans. GitHub profile: @AWS DevOps Resources.

If you want to help fix something or add new resources, links, pages (related to AWS and DevOps)  feel free to submit a PR with your suggested fixes and I'll review.

If you want to use any portion of this repo in your own projects, just make sure you are aware of the license terms ... and I'd appreciate a friendly heads-up :)
